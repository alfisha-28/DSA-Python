Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures.
Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.
Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

What are Data Structures?
A data structure is a way to store data.
We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.

In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
